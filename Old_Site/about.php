            God's Word Working in the Lives of Young People
          </h3>
          <p>
            Since the early 1960s, teen Bible quizzing has been unparalleled in
            encouraging teens to study and memorize God’s Word. With competition
            that rivals any team sport, Bible quizzing offers kids a fun,
            exciting, challenge that gets the word of God into their minds, and
            more importantly, into their hearts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only do the teens who participate learn scripture, they also
            form and nurture relationships with other christian young people
            that often develop into life-long friendships (and an occassional
            marriage).
          </p>
          <p class="pb-4">
            The lasting impact of studying and memorizing God’s Word is
            immeasurable. We often find that the young people who quiz are the
            future pastors, missionaries and lay leaders in their local
            churches. Hebrews 4:12 tells us that “God’s Word is living and
            active...” there is no place where this is more evident than in the
            lives of those who are involved with Bible quizzing.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-left font-weight-bolder">
            In addition to the obvious benefits of learning scripture, there are
            countless benefits of Bible quizzing. Some of those benefits
            include:
          </h3>
          <h5 class="text-left font-weight-bold pt-3">Self-discipline</h5>
          <p>
            Teens learn to be disciplined in their study time in order to
            acheive a goal.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-left font-weight-bold pt-2">
            Establish a Habit of Studying God's Word
          </h5>
          <p>
            Setting aside time to study, and doing so on a regular basis,
            establishes a life-long habit.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-left font-weight-bold pt-2">
            Good All-Around Study Habits
          </h5>
          <p>
            The more the students study, the better they remember and this
            translates into better study habits in school
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-left font-weight-bold pt-2">
            Rapid Recall of Information
          </h5>
          <p>
            Along with good study and memorization skills, these students learn
            to recall the information they have committed to memory, helping
            them in school, college and beyond.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-left font-weight-bold pt-2">
            Teamwork
          </h5>
          <p>
            Bible quizzing is structured in such a way that teamwork is
            necessary to win, encouraging quizzers to “step up” to their
            responsibility as a team member.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-left font-weight-bold pt-2">
            Leadership Skills
          </h5>
          <p class="pb-4">
            Quizzers are not only leaders on their teams, but more often than
            not, they become leaders in their church youth groups, building
            leadership skills for the future.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-left font-weight-bolder">
            Perhaps no one can attest to the benefits of Bible quizzing better
            than those who have been involved in the program throughout the
            years and have experienced those benefits first-hand.

              “I quizzed for 5 years..., memorizing, in order, Romans, James,
              Acts, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon,
              Luke, I Corinthians & II Corinthians.... I owe a huge debt to
              Bible quizzing, or rather, to God, whose grace was made manifest
              in my life through the Bible quizzing program... I have yet to
              come across another program so effective in getting teens to
              memorize the Bible and in creating a love for God’s Word.”

              There is no other program that rivals Bible quizzing. Witnessing
              the power of God’s Word in the lives of the young people I was
              lucky enough to coach has been one of the biggest blessings in my
              life. I saw the things they learned move from their heads into
              their hearts and, in turn, change their lives. My life has been
              richly blessed through the scripture, the kids, and the friends I
              have made in the process.

              “I can honestly say that I might not be walking with Christ today
              and would certainly not be in the ministry if it were not for
              Bible quizzing. That has not only been my experience, but the Word
              of God had the same kind of impact on my teammates. Of the six
              youth that were on our Championship team, three of us are now
              full-time pastors in the Missionary church, one is a pastor’s
              wife, and another young lady became a full-time missionary.
              <strong><em>This kind of impact is commonplace.</em></strong>
              Over the years...I have seen the same kind of thing happen in
              countless lives... Second Timothy 3:16,17 tells us that ‘All
              Scripture is Godbreathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
              correcting, and training in righteousness, so that the man of God
              may be thoroughly equipped for every good work...’ What a critical
              time to be encouraging our youth to be involved in programs like
              Bible quizzing.”

              “Over the years of our involvement with quizzing, we have seen its
              effect on the lives of young people. It establishes the Word in
              their lives like nothing else, and it helps them build wholesome
              relationships that last a lifetime. We have also seen its impact
              on those who watch. The grandparents of one of our quizzers came
              to know the Lord in their senior years. They attributed what they
              saw in the lives of teen quizzers as one of the major influences
              in their decisions to follow Christ.”
